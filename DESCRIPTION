Description: Uses the Smoking Toolkit Study, Office for National Statistics (ONS), and 
    Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) data to produce estimates
    of tobacco spending by local authority and other socio-economic breakdowns to
    calculate the potential dividend to local areas from individuals quitting smoking
    in England.
